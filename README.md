# AIminebot
## these guys did it better than me https://voyager.minedojo.org/ but here's a better UI and setup
A Minecraft bot that uses LLM to converts user's chat into actions for a Minecraft player entity.
## SETUP

1] install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download)<br><br>

2] install [setup file](https://github.com/Seshrut/AIminebot/releases) <br>
{whilst [2] is running start step [3] as it takes a few mins}<br><br>

3] [ google ai studio account ](https://makersuite.google.com/) {its free} and get api key<br><br>

4] run `AIminebot` from desktop{or from the location where you saved the file during setup}<br><br>

<hr>

#### BOT ONLY RESPONDS TO MESSAGES STARTING FROM `@` ‚ö†Ô∏è
